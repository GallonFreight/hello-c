Semantics of DECLARATORs:
Notice that the processes for building up DECLARATORs resemble those for building up certain POSTFIX EXPRESSIONS. To start with, a lone IDENTIFIER can be either a DECLARATOR or a POSTFIX EXPRESSION(specifically, a PRIMARY EXPRESSION).
A DECLARATOR enclosed in parentheses yields another DECLARATOR. Likewise, a POSTFIX EXPRESSION(since it is a type of EXPRESSION) may be enclosed in parentheses to yield a PRIMARY EXPRESSION(which is a type of POSTFIX EXPRESSION).
A POSTFIX EXPRESSION followed by '[' followed by an EXPRESSION followed by ']' is a POSTFIX EXPRESSION. Likewise, a DECLARATOR followed by '[' followed by a CONSTANT(which is a type of EXPRESSION) followed by ']' is a DECLARATOR.
A DECLARATOR followed by '(' followed by a sequence of PARAMETER DECLARATIONs followed by ')' is a DECLARATOR. Likewise, a POSTFIX EXPRESSION followed by '(' followed by an optional ARGUMENT EXPRESSION LIST followed by ')' is a POSTFIX EXPRESSION.
	Where an ARGUMENT EXPRESSION LIST is a sequence of ASSIGNMENT EXPRESSIONs separated by commas and each PARAMETER DECLARATION ends in either a DECLARATOR(which, as we have seen, can correspond to a POSTFIX EXPRESSION, which is a type of ASSIGNMENT EXPRESSION) or an optional ABSTRACT DECLARATOR.
	N.b. Working out how ABSTRACT DECLARATORs correspond is a bit beyond me at this point, so I will come back to this
N.b. there are lots of more complicated constructions of DECLARATORS and EXPRESSIONS at whose correspondences you have not yet hinted, but the suggestions you've made here should be a good point from which to start re-drafting


Semantics of simple-program.c:
simple-program.c:1:	#include <stdio.h>
	Preprocessor directive: I won't go into detail on preprocessor directives here since I'm mostly interested in treating C programs at the level of TRANSLATION UNITs. It will suffice for now to say that the effect of an "#include" directive is to tell the preprocessor to replace the line in which occurs with the content of the text file whose name follows "#include".
